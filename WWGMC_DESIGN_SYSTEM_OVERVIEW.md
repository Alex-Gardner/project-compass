# WWGMC Design System Overview

Short, high-impact notes extracted from https://wwgmc.com/ for later application design work.

## 1. Brand color system
- Core accent: `#e47325` (used frequently for dividers/highlights/visual emphasis).
- Support colors: dark blue `#002b49`, light blue `#92c0e9`, neutrals (`#6d6e71`, `#000000`, `#ffffff`).
- Design effect: strong contrast for CTA moments and a practical enterprise-industrial tone.

## 2. Typography system
- Primary type family: Adobe Typekit `bio-sans`.
- Weights/variants in use: `400`, `600`, `700`, including italics.
- Design effect: clear hierarchy with a clean, modern, professional style.

## 3. Layout and component patterns
- Repeating modules: hero, stats blocks, project grid/cards, testimonial areas, CTA sections.
- Alternating left/right section structure with horizontal accent lines creates recognizable visual rhythm.

## 4. Responsive behavior
- Main breakpoint around `980px`; additional adjustments around `834px`, `600px`, and `1144px`.
- Mobile behavior: stacked columns, reduced decorative elements, simplified spacing/typography for readability.

## 5. Implementation consistency
- Delivered via a WordPress Divi child theme, which drives consistency through reusable page modules.
- Practical implication: fast page assembly with consistent marketing-site patterns.
